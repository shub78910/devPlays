# devPlays
devPlays is a full stack MERN video library app.

Tech stack:
1. <b>MongoDB</b>
2. <b>Express</b>
3. <b>ReactJS</b>
4. <b>NodeJS</b>


You, as a user can:
1. Register and create an account
2. Login
3. View the list of all the videos
4. Watch a particular video
5. Like, add to watchlist, and make new playlists.
6. Add comments.
7. View all your playlists.
8. Add a new video.

I've used JWT based auth, bcrypt for password encryption, and context API.
